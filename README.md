# Poem-Classification-NLP-

Dataset Description

This dataset is for multi-class text classification in the context of poetry. It contains a collection of poems, each labeled with one of four genres:
Affection
Environment
Music
Death
Background
The idea behind this dataset comes from a classroom activity where students were asked to bring a personal item and describe it in three ways:
Emotionally – why it matters to them
Scientifically – a factual description
Poetically – as if the item were speaking
The third part, labeled “Poem,” inspired this dataset.
Use Case
This dataset is useful for learning and applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as:
Text preprocessing (like tokenization and stopword removal)
Feature extraction (such as TF-IDF or word embeddings)
Building multi-class classification models using machine learning or deep learning
Evaluating model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
